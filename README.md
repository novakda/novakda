# Dan Novak — Provider of Clarity

I specialize in **eLearning systems architecture** and **legacy system rescue**—the projects where documentation is incomplete, vendors have departed, and the system is critical but fragile. Over 28 years, I've built SCORM/xAPI platforms, debugged multi-vendor integration nightmares, and applied NTSB investigative methodology to software forensics.

When conventional debugging fails, I bring the unconventional: Swiss cheese model failure analysis, SCORM API emulation for testing, and cross-domain middleware that shipped 5 years before commercial alternatives.

## What I Build

I specialize in **eLearning systems architecture** (SCORM, xAPI, LMS integration) and **legacy system rescue**—the projects where documentation is incomplete, vendors have departed, and the system is critical but fragile.

**Core technologies:** JavaScript (Vue.js, React), HTML5/CSS3, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, cross-platform integration, forensic debugging, SCORM 1.2/2004, xAPI (Tin Can API), AICC, cmi5.

**Approach:** NTSB-style root cause analysis applied to software. When a system fails, I don't just fix the symptom—I map the contributing factors, analyze the Swiss cheese alignment, and recommend systemic improvements.

## Featured Work

### SCORM Debugger — TASBot for eLearning

Built a Vue.js wrapper with SCORM API emulation to eliminate manual testing overhead. Testing cycles dropped from hours to minutes via save state architecture inspired by speedrunning emulators. Creates a mock LMS environment that captures all API calls, lets you save/load testing states, and isolates SCORM integration bugs from content bugs.

### Cross-Domain SCORM Framework

Custom CORS middleware solving iframe sandboxing challenges—production framework delivered 5 years before Rustici's commercial product. Eliminated manual content distribution by enabling centralized hosting with secure cross-domain communication. Still in production at multiple organizations.

### General Motors Investigation — NTSB Forensics for Software

Swiss cheese model forensics: browser debugging + UX analysis + user interviews revealed architecture fragility, not a bug. The system worked perfectly for experts but broke for typical users due to hidden coupling between UI state and data persistence. Applied aviation accident investigation methodology to software failure analysis.

### BP Learning Platform — Reverse-Engineering Undocumented Systems

Inherited undocumented platform with custom xAPI implementation—reverse-engineered integration between Rustici Content Controller and proprietary LMS. No vendor support, no documentation, production deadline approaching. Mapped data flows, reconstructed API contracts, delivered stable integration.

## Currently

**Open to opportunities** in eLearning systems architecture, legacy platform rescue, or technical investigation roles. Especially interested in projects where the documentation is missing and the stakes are high.
